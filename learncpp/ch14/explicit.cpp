/*
The following should not be made explicit:
- copy (and move) constructors (as these do not perform conversions).

The following are typically not made explicit:
- default constructors with no parameters (as these are only used to convert {} to a default object, not something we
typically need to restrict);
- constructors that only accept multiple arguments (as these are typically not a candidate for conversions anyway).

However, if you prefer, the above can be marked as explicit to prevent implicit conversions with empty and
multiple-argument lists.

The following should usually be made explicit:
- constructors that take a single argument.

There are some occasions when it does make sense to make a single-argument constructor non-explicit. This can be useful
when all of the following are true:
- the constructed object is semantically equivalent to the argument value;
- the conversion is performant.

  The C++ standard doesnâ€™t have specific rules that tell the compiler how to convert values to (or from) a
  program-defined type.
  Instead, the compiler will look to see if we have defined some function that it can use to perform such a conversion.
  Such a function is called a user-defined conversion.
  A constructor that can be used to perform an implicit conversion is called a converting constructor. By default, all
  constructors are converting constructors.
